# Task 6 - Rebase

## Discuss About Previous Task

After revert the commit, your log will like this:

```
* (HEAD -> master) Revert "Task 5"
|
|
* Task 5
|
|
* Merge branch 'feature2'
|\
| * (feature2) Task 4.2
| |
| * Task 4.1
* | Task 4.3
|/
* (feature1) Task 3
|
|
*  Task 2
|
|
*  Task 1
```

The content of HEAD is the same as the content of "Merge branch 'feature2'".

`git revert` will revert to previous commit and create a new commit to save it.

But Task 6 is generate, so the content of task file is different from the content of "Merge branch 'feature2'".

You can use `git stash` to stash current change and check task file.
